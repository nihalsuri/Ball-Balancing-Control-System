# Ball Balancing Control System 
## Aim 
The idea behind this project is to develop a system which can be **measured** and **controlled**.  It's a 1 Degree of Freedom system where there's an ultrasonic sensor(HCSRO4) and servo motor(MG995) that controls the pitch of the beam on which the ball is balancing. Several algoritms like PID can be implemented on this and it can be a great educational platform for students who are interested to test out various different control techniques.
